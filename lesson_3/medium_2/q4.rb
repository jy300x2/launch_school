# medium 2 - question 4
# A common idiom used to solve this conundrum is 
# to use the String#split in conjunction with Array#join methods to 
# break our string up and then put it back together again.
# Use this technique to break up the following string and 
# put it back together with the words in reverse order:

sentence = "Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall."
p sentence.split(/\W/).reverse!.join(" ").downcase
