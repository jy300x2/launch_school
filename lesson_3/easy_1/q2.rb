# easy 1 - question 2
# Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. 
# And explain what would happen in the following scenarios: 
# 1. what is != and where should you use it? 
# 2. put ! before something, like !user_name 
# 3. put ! after something, like words.uniq! 
# 4. put ? before something 
# 5. put ? after something 
# 6. put !! before something, like !!user_name

# '!' typically implies mutation for example, uniq vs. uniq!
# '?' is usually associated with a method name, helps clarify its purpose

# 1. means not equals
# 2. reverses boolean equivalent. for example, !true is false
# 3. '!' typically implies mutation for example, uniq vs. uniq!
# 4. '? :' is the ternary operator for if...else
# 5. '?' at the end is usually associated with a method name, helps clarify its purpose
#    doesn't affect function     
# 6. turn any object to its boolean form
